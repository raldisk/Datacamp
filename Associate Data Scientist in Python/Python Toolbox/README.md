In this Python Toolbox course, you'll continue to build more advanced Python skills. First, you'll learn about iterators, objects you have already encountered in the context of for loops. You'll then learn about list comprehensions, which are extremely handy tools for all data professionals and developers working in Python. You'll end the course by working through a case study in which you'll apply all the techniques you learned in both parts of this course.
